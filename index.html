        <h3 class="section-title">The Game Was Great</h3>
        <p>
            Duelyst was a game by Counterplay Games, a studio that later
            dropped the game to develop Godfall. What made Duelyst special
            was the fact that it had all of the same cardplay goodness
            of Hearthstone along with the interesting positioning of
            chess... kind of. I think a more apt way to put it, if less
            widely-known and something that will likely get me labelled a
            nerd, is DnD style positioning. It's the kind of thing that
            really makes you think about how you've placed your units,
            in a way that Hearthstone only kind of captures, mixed with
            the dopamine hit of getting the card you needed to steamroll
            your opponent or trying to wriggle your way out of a tough
            situation when you got a bad roll. It was fun.
        </p> 
        <h3 class="section-title">What Set It Apart</h3>
        <p>
            My first time plaing Duelyst was magical. It was beautiful,
            with incredibly detailed animated sprites and a free-to-play
            model that gave me a good chance of winning even if I didn't
            spend that much money on games. To 16 year old me, who
            didn't have any kind of credit card at the time (thankfully),
            it was like the chains being taken off. No longer did I have
            to labor for tens of hours just to build up the resources
            to build a deck so I could actually play the game. I was
            right there, in the middle of it! And boy was it fun. It's
            hard to really convey fun in writing. It was nail-biting to
            think I'd lost, just to eventually realize that I did have a
            way to finish off my opponent and eke out victory. It was
            interesting to see each game unfold, each person getting dealt
            a hand by the powers that be, each advantage being converted
            and where making the right play, often in this game theory-esque
            series of plays that were 10 layers deep, often made all the
            difference.
        </p> 
        <p>
            You might even say, "that just sounds like Hearthstone," to
            which I would say, "you're right." To me, though, it was
            better. The art was endearing, the sprites carefully animated
            to convey character, personality, and even culture. Each
            hit was satisfying, and the games were always short but fun.
            It was card-based games, distilled down to the best parts.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The truth is, though, I haven't been completely honest. There
            was a point where I had fallen off the train and stopped
            playing. Some personal things happened and I just never
            got back around to it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">And It's Gone Now</h3>
        <p>
            Recently, the game popped back into my mind. I checked the
            Steam page. The install button didn't work. I looked down at
            the announcements and to my surprise the game had been shut
            down. Gone. Forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still think sometimes of what could've been.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">Conclusions</h3>
        <p> 
            Duelyst was a one-of-a-kind game for me. It was when
            everything that I liked in games lined up just right, in a
            way that's hard to get because not enough games like the
            games that I like.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            It didn't really take off, but when it was here, I really enjoyed
            it. If someone did bring it back, it wouldn't be the same. But
            to me, at the time, Counterplay Games made something special,
            and I'm grateful.
